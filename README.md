# Instakart-Market-Based-Analysis
Market Based Analysis for Instakart to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order.

Apply data science techniques to customer shopping dataset:
<ul>
  <ol>(1) Predict possible items that a customer would likely reorder in future </ol>
  <ol>(2) Find interesting association among products that a customer would buy together using Apriori data mining algorithm.
    </ul>
  
The objective of this project is to apply the data science techniques and principles on the order-product details dataset and make the following 2 predictions:
<ul><ol>1.	Using standard scikit-learn algorithms and predict if a particular item (product) has the possibility to be re-ordered.</ol>
<ol>2.	Apply Apriori association rule data mining techniques to find the combination of product items that has a possibility of being ordered together with a given confidence level.</ol>
  </ul>
  
<h4>Dataset</h4>

The dataset for this project was taken from kaggle. The data set contains transactions data set that contains a set of orders and the list of products in each order with a flag specifying if a particular item in that order was a re-order or the first order.
